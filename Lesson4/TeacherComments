FYI: When you're asked to find count of DIFFERENT items, you better use COUNT(DISTINCT <field_name>)

Why do you join tables yourself if you can (and should) use view vSalesPerson?

Your solution failed testing. It returns correct answer only for the current month.
I've run this query: SELECT DATEADD(day, -DAY( DATEADD(MONTH, 1, GETDATE()))+2,  DATEADD(MONTH, 1, GETDATE())).
Your query just returns 2nd day for all months.

Mark: 10.
