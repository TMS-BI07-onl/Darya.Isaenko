Well done!

a) -1
Correct answer:	SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT PersonType) AS DistinctCount
		FROM Person.Person
		WHERE LastName LIKE 'M%' 
			OR NOT EmailPromotion LIKE '%1%' 
You forgot to add count. When the task is about calculating amount of rows, you can't rely on the number in the corner of the window.
Second condition is not "equal", it's "including". For example, if after next data update there is a EmailPromotion 3451654, it should be added to the final result set.
d) 
Expected answer:
	SELECT  ProductSubcategoryID,
		MIN(Weight) AS Min_weight, 
		MAX(Size) AS Max_size
	FROM Production.Product
	GROUP BY ProductSubcategoryID
     Actually, you were not wrong with excluding ProductSubcategoryID from select, but I think it's obvious that without this column it's hard to read and understand query results. 
e) 
The same issue as in the d.
